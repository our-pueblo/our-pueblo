    <h1>What is Our Pueblo?</h1>
    <p>Our Pueblo is an application created to facilitate the volunteer-based translation of the entire City of San Antonio website.</p>
    <h1>How Does it Work?</h1>
    <p>The way it works is simple.<br/><br/>

        1. Employees log in and request for a page to be translated. (Copy and Paste the URL)<br/>
        2. Volunteers log in and request a page to translate. (Choose from a list)<br/>
        3. They compare the original English text with the results from Google Translate, correcting any mistakes.<br/>
        4. Once their translation is submitted, an employee reviews the text before it is accepted.<br/>
        5. When an employee accepts a translation, the volunteer is notified via email of the new status.<br/><br/>

        It is just that easy!
