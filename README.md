Our Pueblo is an application designed to facilitate the large-scale volunteer translation of the pages on the City of San Antonio website. Employees are treated as administrators, and granted higher-level privileges than the common user or volunteer. This application utilizes an API called JSOUP for web scraping as well as the Google Cloud Translation API to provide a baseline translation for the userâ€™s reference.
